Introduction
* As a Data Engineer. My mission is giving the best dataset for furthure advanced analytics.
* As a Data Scintiest. My mission is applying statistical skill to analyze data in advance and giving best prediction for decision-making.

Preview: This project is a combination between DE and DS workskill. I have applied framework bases on Azure for ETL methodology. Then using the dataset after cleaning and transforming, I have turned them into R for DS analyzing futhure.

Tool:
* Azure Data Factory - Data Intergation 
* Data Lake Gen 2 - Raw & Transformed Data Store
* Azure Databricks - Data Transformations
* Azure Synapse Analytics - Advanced Analytics
* R Studio - DS Advanced Analytics
